            <p>Freewriting is the practice of writing down all your thoughts without stopping, and without regard for spelling, grammar, or any of the usual rules for writing. It might include a topic as a general guide, or it might not. The purpose of the exercise varies, but it can be used to generate ideas and to clear out distracting thoughts. There are various possible forms of freewriting, such as journals, essays, and fiction writing.

                When you freewrite in your journal, you write down anything that comes to mind. You might decide to set a limit, such as the number of pages or a time limit. Freewriting in your journal is different from reflecting and working through a problem. When you freewrite in a journal, every random idea and impulse goes on the page, and you should write without stopping. You might encounter an idea that you want to explore during the freewrite, and this is an impulse that you should follow. The main thing is to not begin the freewrite with any topic in mind.</p>
